# Overview
There has been a lot of talk recently about expanding the college football playoff from 4 teams to 12 teams. In the proposed format, automatic bids would be awarded to the six highest-ranked conference champions, and at-large bids would be awarded to the remaining six highest-ranked teams. If approved, this setup will likely take several years to go into effect, but that does not mean we cannot have a look at the "what-ifs" from past seasons. You might be surprised to find that your team would have had a chance, or even multiple chances, to compete for a national championship under the 12-team format.
