# Overview
There has been a lot of talk recently about expanding the college football playoff from 4 teams to 12 teams. In the proposed format, automatic bids would be awarded to the six highest-ranked conference champions, and at-large bids would be awarded to the remaining six highest-ranked teams. If approved, this setup will likely take several years to go into effect, but that does not mean we cannot have a look at the "what-ifs" from past seasons. You might be surprised to find that your team would have had a chance, or even multiple chances, to compete for a national championship under the 12-team format.     
# Which Past Seasons?
Included in this lookback are the hypothetical 12-team brackets for every season dating back to 1998. For the 1998-2013 seasons the final BCS(Bowl Championship Series) rankings were used to create the brackets and for the 2014-2020 seasons the final CFP(College Football Playoff) rankings were used to create the brackets. It is important to note that the BCS and CFP rankings are likely not a perfect reflection of what a 12-team college football playoff committee would have determined the rankings to be, but for now those are the best substitutes available.
